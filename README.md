 ## Task 01: Python Data Visualization

## Overview  

This project focuses on creating and understanding basic data visualizations using Python.

The task demonstrates how graphical representations such as bar charts, line charts, and pie charts can be used to analyze and interpret data effectively.

## Dataset  

A simple sales dataset was used for visualization purposes.

The dataset includes information such as:

- Product Name  
- Sales Amount  
- Time/Category-based values  

The dataset was analyzed to understand trends and comparisons using different visualization techniques.

## Tools & Libraries Used  

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas (Data handling)  
- Matplotlib (Data visualization)  

## Visualizations Created  

### 1️) Bar Chart  

Used to compare sales values across different categories or products.

Purpose:  
Helps in comparing quantities clearly and quickly.

### 2️) Line Chart  

Used to show trends over time.

Purpose:  
Helps in understanding patterns and changes over a period.

### 3) Pie Chart  

Used to represent proportional distribution of categories.

Purpose:  
Helps visualize percentage contribution of each category.

## Key Insights  

- Bar charts help compare category-wise performance.  
- Line charts clearly show trends and patterns.  
- Pie charts effectively display proportional data distribution.  
- Visualization simplifies complex numerical data.

## Conclusion  

This task demonstrates fundamental data visualization techniques using Python.

Understanding visualization is an important step in data analysis as it helps in identifying patterns, trends, and insights effectively.
